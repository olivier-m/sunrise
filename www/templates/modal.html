  <p>What? No. We can't stop here. This is bat country. We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us. A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip. We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us. We're not sheep! Well, then, I confess, it is my intention to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, raid, pillage, plunder and otherwise pilfer my weasely black guts out.

Those peppers! Forget about it!" Holy Jesus. What are these goddamn animals? We are very much alike, you and I, I and you... us.</p>
  <p>Do you like my meadow? Try some of my grass! Please have a blade, please do, it's so delectable and so darn good looking! What? No. We can't stop here. This is bat country. What? No. We can't stop here. This is bat country. A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth. But no one should be asked to handle this trip. Me? I'm dishonest, and a dishonest man you can always trust to be dishonest. Honestly. It's the honest ones you want to watch out for, because you can never predict when they're going to do something incredibly... stupid. We had two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a saltshaker half-full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers...
