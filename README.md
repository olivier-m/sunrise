# Sunrise CSS

## What is it?

Sunrise is a lightweight CSS framework providing rules for basic needs. It is not a full
featured framework with shiny widgets, only a starter kit with useful tools.

## What's in it?

Sunrise provides the following CSS components:

- A CSS normalization based on [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
- Typographic consistency and vertical rhythm for your texts
- A responsive grid system (fixed and fluid) and an automated distribution grid
- Beautiful forms

## Install it

Add `sunrise.css` to your project/page and you're good to go.

## Hack it

Clone Sunrise repository and then enter the following commands (you need nodeJS and Grunt):

```
npm install
grunt runserver
```


You can now visit `http://localhost:7000/`, edit files in `src/` and save your changes.

Sunrise uses the amazing [Stylus](https://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) CSS preprocessor.
